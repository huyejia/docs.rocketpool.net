# Masquerading as Another Node Address

Starting with Smartnode version `v1.15.7`, users will be able to mock the behaviour of an arbitrary address. While masquerading as another address, 
your node will continue the node and watchtower task loop using your node address and perform duties such as attesting using your validator keys. You will not be able
to submit transactions or sign messages as the masqueraded address. This feature is especially useful for support and debugging.

If you wish to interact with the Smartnode through the lens of another node address, please use the following command: `rocketpool wallet masquerade`

```
rp@user:~$ rocketpool wallet masquerade

Masquerading allows you to set your node address to any address you want. All commands will 
act as though your node wallet is for that address. Since you don't have the private key for
that address, you can't submit transactions or sign messages though; commands will be read-only 
until you end the masquerade with `rocketpool wallet end-masquerade`.

Please enter an address to masquerade as:
0xcaB549EdE082592D10FE6a238e7e8914aD3a074d 

Are you sure you want to masquerade as 0xcaB549EdE082592D10FE6a238e7e8914aD3a074d? [y/n]
y

Your node is now masquerading as address 0xcaB549EdE082592D10FE6a238e7e8914aD3a074d.
```
When you are finished with masquerade mode, simply run `rocketpool wallet end-masquerade` and follow the prompts:
```
rp@user:~$ rocketpool wallet end-masquerade

The node wallet is 0xE8325F5f4486c2FF2AC7B522Fbc9eB249d46C936. You will no longer be masquerading as 0xcaB549EdE082592D10FE6a238e7e8914aD3a074d.

Are you sure you want to end masquerade mode? [y/n]
y

Successfully ended masquerade mode.
```
Additionally, you can check the status of your node wallet by running `rocketpool wallet status`: 
```
rp@node:~$ rocketpool wallet status

Your Smart Node is currently using the Hoodi Test Network.

The node wallet is initialized, but you are currently masquerading as 0xcaB549EdE082592D10FE6a238e7e8914aD3a074d
Wallet Address: 0xE8325F5f4486c2FF2AC7B522Fbc9eB249d46C936
Due to this mismatch, the node cannot submit transactions. Use the command 'rocketpool wallet end-masquerade' to end masquerading and restore your wallet address.
