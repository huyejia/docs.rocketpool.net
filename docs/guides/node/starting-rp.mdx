# Starting Rocket Pool

At this point, you should have the complete Rocket Pool infrastructure running, including the Smartnode stack, an Execution and a Consensus client.
You should also have hardened your operating system from outside attackers.
If you've completed both of these steps, you're ready to create a Rocket Pool node and begin staking.
If not, please review the previous sections and return here once you've completed those steps.

## Starting and Stopping the Rocket Pool Services


<div className="p-3">
  <Tabs>
    <Tab label="Docker (Default) Mode">
      Now that you have the Smartnode installed, starting the stack is easy.
      Simply enter the following command:

      ```shell
      rocketpool service start
      ```

      This command will create all of the necessary Docker images if they don't already exist, make sure the Rocket Pool docker network and storage volumes have been initialized, and update any containers if they no longer match the configuration settings from `rocketpool service config`'s UI.

      The first time you do it, the output should look like this:

      ```
      $ rocketpool service start

      Creating network "rocketpool_net" with the default driver
      Creating volume "rocketpool_eth1clientdata" with default driver
      Creating volume "rocketpool_eth2clientdata" with default driver
      Creating rocketpool_eth1 ...
      Creating rocketpool_eth1 ... done
      Creating rocketpool_eth2 ...
      Creating rocketpool_api  ...
      Creating rocketpool_api  ... done
      Creating rocketpool_eth2 ... done
      Creating rocketpool_watchtower ...
      Creating rocketpool_mev-boost   ...
      Creating rocketpool_mev-boost   ... done
      Creating rocketpool_node       ...
      Creating rocketpool_validator  ...
      Creating rocketpool_validator  ... done
      Creating rocketpool_node       ... done
      Creating rocketpool_watchtower ... done
      ```

      If it does, then the Smartnode stack has been successfully initialized and is now running.

      If you ever need to stop the services (for example, during an upgrade or because you need to do maintenance), you can use `rocketpool service stop` to shut everything down.
      The output should look like this:

      ```
      $ rocketpool service stop

      Are you sure you want to pause the Rocket Pool service? Any staking minipools will be penalized! [y/n]

        Once you call this, Rocket Pool will **not** automatically start after a system reboot.

      </p>
    </Tab>
    <Tab label="Hybrid Mode">
      Now that you have the Smartnode installed, starting the stack is easy.
      Simply enter the following command:

      ```shell

      This command will create all of the necessary Docker images if they don't already exist, make sure the Rocket Pool docker network and storage volumes have been initialized, and update any containers if they no longer match the configuration settings from `rocketpool service config`'s UI.

      Creating rocketpool_watchtower ... done
      ```

      If it does, then the Smartnode stack has been successfully initialized and is now running.

      Note that your external Execution and/or Consensus clients will not be listed here, as Rocket Pool does not manage them and thus cannot start them.
      You will have to ensure that you've started them separately, using whatever mechanism you originally created them with.

      If you ever need to stop the services (for example, during an upgrade or because you need to do maintenance), you can use `rocketpool service stop` to shut everything down.
      The output should look like this:

      ```

      Stopping rocketpool_watchtower ... done
      Stopping rocketpool_api        ... done

      Again, you will be responsible for manually ensuring that your Execution and Consensus clients are stopped appropriately as well, if you want them to be stopped.

    </Tab>
    <Tab label="Native Mode">
      In native mode, you already set up and started the Smartnode services as part of the [Configuring a Native Rocket Pool Node without Docker](./native) section.

      Assuming you set them up as `systemd` services, you can start them with `sudo systemctl start ...`.
      For example, if you are using Geth for Execution and Teku for Consensus:

      ```shell
      sudo systemctl start geth teku-bn teku-vc rp-node rp-watchtower
      ```

      Stopping them is the same process, but using `sudo systemctl stop ...`.

      Note that stopping the services **does not disable autostart**; the processes will automatically start upon a reboot.

    </Tab>
  </Tabs>
</div>


## Confirming the Correct Version and Network

Once the containers or services are up, a good first step is to confirm that you have the correct versions of the clients and are on the network that you expect.
You can do this with the following command:

```shell
rocketpool service version
```

The output will look like this **(note that you may have a newer version than what is displayed here, this is just an example)**:

```
Your Smartnode is currently using the Ethereum Mainnet.

Rocket Pool client version: 1.6.4
Rocket Pool service version: 1.6.4
Selected Eth 1.0 client: Geth (Locally managed)
Image: ethereum/client-go:v1.10.25
Selected Eth 2.0 client: Lighthouse (Locally managed)
Image: sigp/lighthouse:v3.1.0
```

The first line will tell you if your Smartnode is configured for the Ethereum mainnet or for the Hoodi testnet.

::: warning NOTE
  **For Docker / Hybrid users:**
  If you are not on the network you expect to be on, go back to the Installing Rocket Pool section and review the installation instructions - you may have missed the portion that has different instructions depending on which network you want to use.

  **For Native users:**
  If you accepted the default settings when you first ran `rp service config`, then it's possible that the network reported here is incorrect.
  Simply switch it in the `rp service config` TUI, in the `Smartnode` section, to the proper network and restart your `node` and `watchtower` services.
:::

The second set of lines will tell you which clients you're using, and which versions of them are defined in Rocket Pool's configuration.

## Checking the Service Status and Logs

Now that the Smartnode services have been started, it's a good idea to check that they're running correctly without errors.

<div className="p-3">
  <Tabs>
    <Tab label="Docker (Default) Mode">
      The first thing to check is whether the Docker containers are running well, or if they are constantly restarting due to an error.
      Run the following command:

      ```shell
      docker ps
      ```

      The results should look like this:

      ```

      ```

      The key thing to check is the `STATUS` column.
      If none of the entries state `Restarting...`, then the containers should be running properly (see the below note for an exception about the `rocketpool_validator` container).


      <p className="rspress-directive warning">
        <p className="rspress-directive-title">NOTE</p>
        If you are using Prysm or Lodestar as your Consensus client, you will likely notice the `rocketpool_validator` container is constantly restarting.
        This is okay!
        The validator container will fail until a new validator has been created using the `rocketpool node deposit` command, which we will cover in the [Creating a Minipool (Validator)](./create-validator) section.
        Once this is done, the container will function correctly - until then, just ignore it.
      </p>

      Still, it might be useful to check the logs of the various services.

      To check on the logs, use the `rocketpool service logs container` command, where `container` is one of `eth1`, `eth2`, `validator`, `api`, `node`, or `watchtower`.

      For example, to check the logs for your ETH1 client:

      ```
      $ rocketpool service logs eth1

      Attaching to rocketpool_eth1

      You should do this for both `eth1` and `eth2` to make sure both clients are running without any errors.

      ```shell
      /srv/geth/log.sh

::: tip TIP
When you're done looking at the logs, you can exit and return to the command prompt using `Ctrl + C`.
:::

## Waiting for Your ETH Clients to Sync

Now that your clients have started up, you're going to want to wait until your Execution and Consensus clients have finished syncing with the network before proceeding.

One easy way to check on their status is with the following command:

```shell
rocketpool node sync
```

This command will show how far along your Execution & Consensus clients are in the syncing process, similar to this:

```shell
$ rocketpool node sync

Your Smartnode is currently using the Hoodi Test Network.

Your eth2 client is on the correct network.

Your primary execution client is fully synced.
You do not have a fallback execution client enabled.
Your consensus client is still syncing (99.69%).
```

You can call this occasionally to keep tabs on your clients' progress.

To get an actual ETA of the sync time, it's easiest to look at the logs for your clients with `rocketpool service logs eth1` and `rocketpool service logs eth2` respectively (or the equivalent log script commands if you're using the hybrid / native modes.)
Each client typically provides an ETA on its sync status in its log output.

::: tip NOTE
It can take **days** to fully sync both ETH1 and ETH2 depending on your client selection and your machine's hardware profile.
**This is expected**.
Sit back, relax, and wait for both of them to finish.
:::

::: warning NOTE
If your node is not syncing at all or has no peers, it may be because your router is blocking ports 30303 and 9001. If they're closed, you'll need to setup port forwarding on your router. Also, make sure your node has a static local IP address so the port forwarding does not break due to your node getting a new address.
:::

## Next Steps

Once your clients have synced, you're ready to either [create a new wallet](./wallet-init) if this is your first node, or [recover an existing wallet](./recovering-rp) if you're restoring from a backup or migrating from another provider such as Allnodes to your own hardware.

Select which one you'd like to learn more about and follow the steps in the corresponding guide.
