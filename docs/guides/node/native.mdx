# Creating a Native Rocket Pool Node without Docker

::: tip NOTE
This guide is designed for **Smartnode v1.6.5 and higher**.

If you are using a previous version, you must upgrade to v1.6.5 or higher before configuring Native mode.
:::

In this section, we will walk through the process of installing the Rocket Pool Smartnode stack natively onto your system, without the use of Docker containers.

The general plan is as follows:

1. Create a standard solo-staking setup with `systemd` services for the Execution Client, the Consensus Client / Beacon Node, and the Validator Client
2. Create system services for the Rocket Pool components (the **node** and **watchtower** processes)
3. Configure Rocket Pool to communicate with your client services
4. Update your Validator Client service definition to use Rocket Pool's fee recipient and validator keys

This is a fairly involved setup so it will take some time to complete.

The diversity of Operating Systems and distros available make it impractical to make guides available for all of them.
The instructions in this guide are tailored to a Debian-based system (including Ubuntu).
For other distros or operating systems, you may follow the high-level steps described in the guide but will have to substitute certain commands for the ones that your system uses as appropriate.

::: danger
This guide is intended for users that are experienced with Linux system administration and usage.
This includes using the terminal, creating system accounts, managing permissions, and installing services.
We assume you are familiar with these activities - as you will be managing the bulk of the infrastructure yourself, we only provide limited support for Native installations.
**If you are not familiar with these activities, we do not recommend that you use Native Mode.**
:::

## Step 1: Set up the Execution and Consensus Clients

Native Mode effectively extends a standard solo-staking setup, and simply allows the Smartnode software to attach to the clients that it already runs (with a few small modifications).

To that end, we recommend you start by following some of the conventional solo staking guides provided by the community:

- Somer Esat's set of guides per-client: [https://github.com/SomerEsat/ethereum-staking-guides](https://github.com/SomerEsat/ethereum-staking-guides)
- CoinCashew guides: [https://www.coincashew.com/coins/overview-eth/guide-or-how-to-setup-a-validator-on-eth2-mainnet](https://www.coincashew.com/coins/overview-eth/guide-or-how-to-setup-a-validator-on-eth2-mainnet)

Note that **you won't actually create a validator as defined in those guides** - Rocket Pool will do that for you.
**You can ignore the portions involving the Staking Deposit CLI tool.**

You simply need to follow the guides to the point where you have an Execution Client service, a Consensus Client / Beacon Node service, and a Validator Client service all installed and syncing the chain.
**Skip the steps that involve funding a validator and recording its mnemonic.**

Also, there is a special case for the **fee recipient** - when you get to the portion of the guide where you specify the fee recipient in your Validator Client configuration, **leave it blank for now**.
We will describe how to set it up for Rocket Pool validators below.

Once your clients are installed and you can see in their logs that they are syncing the chains properly, you can follow the next steps to set up the Rocket Pool Smartnode and connect it to your clients.

## Step 2: Install Rocket Pool

### Creating the Service Account

The first step is to create a new system account for the Rocket Pool services and disable login and shell access for it:

```shell
sudo useradd -r -s /sbin/nologin rp
```

Now, add yourself to the `rp` group.
You'll need to do this in order to use the Rocket Pool CLI, because it and the Rocket Pool daemon both need to access the Execution layer wallet file.

```shell
sudo usermod -aG rp $USER
```

Finally, add the user account for your **Validator Client** to the `rp` group as well.
The name of that user account depends on which guide you followed to set up your VC service.

For example, if your VC runs as user `lighthousevalidator`, you would do the following:

```shell
sudo usermod -aG rp lighthousevalidator
```

After this, logout and back in for the changes to take effect.

### Setting up the Binaries

Start by making a folder for Rocket Pool and a data subfolder.
You can put this wherever you want; for this guide, I'll put it into `/srv`:

```shell
sudo mkdir -p /srv/rocketpool

sudo chown $USER:$USER /srv/rocketpool
```

Now, download the CLI and daemon binaries (or ignore this and build them from source if you prefer).
Choose the platform that your system uses from the tabs below.

<div className="p-3">
  <Tabs>
    <Tab label="Linux x64">
      ```shell
      sudo wget https://github.com/rocket-pool/smartnode-install/releases/latest/download/rocketpool-cli-linux-amd64 -O /usr/local/bin/rocketpool

      sudo wget https://github.com/rocket-pool/smartnode-install/releases/latest/download/rocketpool-daemon-linux-amd64 -O /usr/local/bin/rocketpoold

      sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/rocketpool
      ```
    </Tab>
    <Tab label="Linux arm64">
      ```shell
      sudo wget https://github.com/rocket-pool/smartnode-install/releases/latest/download/rocketpool-cli-linux-arm64 -O /usr/local/bin/rocketpool

      sudo wget https://github.com/rocket-pool/smartnode-install/releases/latest/download/rocketpool-daemon-linux-arm64 -O /usr/local/bin/rocketpoold

      sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/rocketpool
      ```
    </Tab>
    <Tab label="macOS x64">
      ```shell
      sudo wget https://github.com/rocket-pool/smartnode-install/releases/latest/download/rocketpool-cli-darwin-amd64 -O /usr/local/bin/rocketpool

      sudo wget https://github.com/rocket-pool/smartnode-install/releases/latest/download/rocketpool-daemon-darwin-amd64 -O /usr/local/bin/rocketpoold

      sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/rocketpool
      ```
    </Tab>
    <Tab label="macOS arm64">
      ```shell
      sudo wget https://github.com/rocket-pool/smartnode-install/releases/latest/download/rocketpool-cli-darwin-arm64 -O /usr/local/bin/rocketpool

      sudo wget https://github.com/rocket-pool/smartnode-install/releases/latest/download/rocketpool-daemon-darwin-arm64 -O /usr/local/bin/rocketpoold

      sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/rocketpool
      ```
    </Tab>
  </Tabs>
</div>


Now, set the owner and group of the daemon to `rp`:

```shell
sudo chown rp:rp /usr/local/bin/rocketpoold
```

Finally, **set the `suid` bit** and other permissions bits on the daemon binary:

```shell
sudo chmod u+sx,g+sx,o-rwx /usr/local/bin/rocketpoold
```

This will ensure that the daemon always runs as the `rp` user, so it always has the proper permissions set.

::: danger NOTE
The Smartnode will most likely fail with permissions errors if you don't do this.
Please be sure to run this command!
:::

### Setting up the Installation Folder

With the CLI and Daemon installed, you'll need to next set up the folder structure and accompanying files that the Smartnode expects to exist.
Start by creating the following folders:

```
mkdir -p /srv/rocketpool/data/validators && sudo chmod 775 /srv/rocketpool/data/validators

mkdir /srv/rocketpool/data/rewards-trees

mkdir /srv/rocketpool/data/custom-keys

sudo chown -R rp:rp /srv/rocketpool/data
```

Next, download the following scripts - Rocket Pool will use them when it needs to stop or restart your Validator Client to change its fee recipient (discussed later) or load new keys after you create a new minipool:

```shell
wget https://github.com/rocket-pool/smartnode/raw/master/shared/services/rocketpool/assets/install/scripts/restart-vc.sh -O /srv/rocketpool/restart-vc.sh

wget https://github.com/rocket-pool/smartnode/raw/master/shared/services/rocketpool/assets/install/scripts/stop-validator.sh -O /srv/rocketpool/stop-validator.sh

chmod +x /srv/rocketpool/restart-vc.sh

chmod +x /srv/rocketpool/stop-validator.sh
```

Now open `~/.profile` with your editor of choice and add this line to the end:

```shell
alias rp="rocketpool -d /usr/local/bin/rocketpoold -c /srv/rocketpool"
```

Save it, then reload your profile:

```shell
source ~/.profile
```

This will let you interact with Rocket Pool's CLI with the `rp` command, which is a nice shortcut.

### Creating the Services

Next up, we'll create a `systemd` service for the Rocket Pool node daemon.
This is the service that will automatically check for and claim RPL rewards after each checkpoint, and stake minipools once you've created them via `node deposit`.

We'll also create a `watchtower` service as well.
This will be used if you're an Oracle DAO member, or if you ever want to generate your own rewards interval trees (discussed in the [Claiming Rewards](./rewards) section later on).


<div className="p-3">
  <Tabs>
    <Tab label="Node">
      Create the `rp-node` service:

      ```shell
      sudo nano /etc/systemd/system/rp-node.service
      ```

      Contents:

      ```
      [Unit]
      Description=rp-node
      After=network.target

      [Service]
      Type=simple
      User=rp
      Restart=always
      RestartSec=5
      ExecStart=/usr/local/bin/rocketpoold --settings /srv/rocketpool/user-settings.yml node

      [Install]
      WantedBy=multi-user.target
      ```

      Create a log file for the service, so you can watch its output - this will replace the behavior of `rocketpool service logs node`:

      ```
      nano /srv/rocketpool/node-log.sh
      ```

      Contents:

      ```
      #!/bin/bash
      journalctl -u rp-node -b -f
      ```

      Save it, then make it executable:

      ```
      chmod +x /srv/rocketpool/node-log.sh
      ```

      Now you can watch the node's logs by simply running:

      ```shell
      sudo /srv/rocketpool/node-log.sh
      ```
    </Tab>
    <Tab label="Watchtower">
      Create a service for the watchtower:

      ```shell
      sudo nano /etc/systemd/system/rp-watchtower.service
      ```

      Contents:

      ```
      [Unit]
      Description=rp-node
      After=network.target

      [Service]
      Type=simple
      User=rp
      Restart=always
      RestartSec=5
      ExecStart=/usr/local/bin/rocketpoold --settings /srv/rocketpool/user-settings.yml watchtower

      [Install]
      WantedBy=multi-user.target
      ```

      Create a log file for the watchtower:

      ```
      nano /srv/rocketpool/watchtower-log.sh
      ```

      Contents:

      ```
      #!/bin/bash
      journalctl -u rp-watchtower -b -f
      ```

      Save it, then make it executable:

      ```
      chmod +x /srv/rocketpool/watchtower-log.sh
      ```

      Now you can watch the watchtower's logs by simply running:

      ```shell
      sudo /srv/rocketpool/watchtower-log.sh
      ```
    </Tab>
  </Tabs>
</div>

The services are now installed.

### Setting up Passwordless Script Access

The next step is to give the `rp` user the ability to restart the Validator Client when new validator keys are created, and stop the Validator Client if an emergency condition is detected.

Create a new `sudoers` file using `visudo`:

```shell
sudo visudo -f /etc/sudoers.d/rocketpool
```

Add the following lines to it:

```
Cmnd_Alias RP_RESTART = /usr/bin/systemctl restart <validator service name>
Cmnd_Alias RP_STOP = /usr/bin/systemctl stop <validator service name>
rp    ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: RP_RESTART, RP_STOP
```

Where `<validator service name>` is the name of your VC service (e.g. `lighthousevalidator`)

Now, modify `/srv/rocketpool/restart-vc.sh`:

- Uncomment the line at the end and change it to `sudo systemctl restart <validator service name>`

Also modify `/srv/rocketpool/stop-validator.sh`:

- Uncomment the line at the end and change it to `sudo systemctl stop <validator service name>`

All set!
The `node` process can now restart or stop your VC as required automatically.

## Step 3: Configure the Smartnode

Now that your services are all created, it's time to configure the Smartnode stack.

Please visit the [Configuring the Smartnode Stack (Native Mode)](./config-native) guide, and return here when you are finished.

### Enabling and Running the Services

With all of the services installed, it's time to:

- Enable them so they'll automatically restart if they break, and automatically start on a reboot
- Start them all

```shell
sudo systemctl daemon-reload

sudo systemctl enable rp-node rp-watchtower

sudo systemctl start rp-node rp-watchtower
```

### Setting Up a Wallet

Next, create a new node wallet or recover an existing wallet.
Please carefully follow the instructions in the [Setting up a Wallet](./wallet-init) portion of the guide, then return here when you're done.

Once that's done, use the service log file scripts to verify that they successfully loaded your new wallet.
You should also verify this using the following command:

```shell
rp wallet status
```

If working properly it should produce the following output:

```
Your Smartnode is currently using the Hoodi Test Network.

The node wallet is initialized.
Node account: <address>
```

## Step 4: Update the VC Service Definition

Unlike a solo staking setup, Rocket Pool generates and manages its validator keys automatically.
There are a few adjustments you'll need to make to the VC service definition file you just created in order for it to work with Rocket Pool correctly, including:

- The **Fee Recipient**
- The VC's data or wallet directory
- The VC's keys and secrets directories

We'll cover these step-by-step for each client.

### Setting Up the Fee Recipient File

::: danger NOTE
It is **crucial** that you follow these steps - failing to do so and using the wrong fee recipient will result in [penalties](https://github.com/rocket-pool/rocketpool-research/blob/master/Penalties/penalty-system) being applied to your validators and deductions taken from your Beacon Chain balance!
:::

The **fee recipient** is the argument you provide to your Validator Client that specifies the address on the Execution layer that you want your priority fees and MEV rewards to be sent to.
Rocket Pool has two different addresses for the fee recipient:

- If you are opted into the Smoothing Pool, it must be the **Smoothing Pool's address**
- If you are opted out of the Smoothing Pool, it must be **your node's Fee Distributor address**

_To learn more about the Smoothing Pool and your Fee Distributor, please see the [Fee Distributors and the Smoothing Pool](./fee-distrib-sp) section of the guide._

Rocket Pool's `node` service will set this for you automatically by detecting which one it needs to be and setting it in a configuration file and restarting your Validator Client service to pick up the change.
Your Validator Client service can use that configuration file automatically so you don't need to hard-code the fee recipient.

Open the `systemd` service definition file that you just created for your Validator Client.
Before the `ExecStart` line, add this line:

```
EnvironmentFile=/srv/rocketpool/data/validators/rp-fee-recipient-env.txt
```

Then modify your fee recipient argument as follows; select your client of choice from the tabs below:

<div className="p-3">
  <Tabs>
    <Tab label="Lighthouse">
      Change `--suggested-fee-recipient address` to `--suggested-fee-recipient ${FEE_RECIPIENT}`
    </Tab>
    <Tab label="Nimbus">
      Change `--suggested-fee-recipient=address` to `--suggested-fee-recipient=${FEE_RECIPIENT}`
    </Tab>
    <Tab label="Prysm">
      Change `--suggested-fee-recipient address` to `--suggested-fee-recipient ${FEE_RECIPIENT}`
    </Tab>
    <Tab label="Teku">
      Change `--validators-proposer-default-fee-recipient=address` to `--validators-proposer-default-fee-recipient=${FEE_RECIPIENT}`
    </Tab>
  </Tabs>
</div>

::: tip NOTE
If you start your Validator Client before Rocket Pool's services, it may error out because this file does not exist yet.
Don't worry, this file will be created by Rocket Pool once you've initialized and started its services.
:::

### Setting the Data and Keys Directories

Next, you must tell the VC where to store its data and load the validator keys that Rocket Pool generates.
Click on the client you use in the tabs below:


<div className="p-3">
  <Tabs>
    <Tab label="Lighthouse">
      Create the following directories and set their owner to `rp`:

      ```shell
      sudo mkdir -p /srv/rocketpool/data/validators/lighthouse/validators

      sudo mkdir -p /srv/rocketpool/data/validators/lighthouse/secrets

      sudo chown -R rp:rp /srv/rocketpool/data/validators/lighthouse

      sudo chmod -R 775 /srv/rocketpool/data/validators/lighthouse
      ```

      Now, add or change the following parameters in the Lighthouse VC's service definition file to these new values:

      ```
      --datadir /srv/rocketpool/data/validators/lighthouse
      ```
    </Tab>
    <Tab label="Nimbus">
      Create the following directories and set their owner to `rp`:

      ```shell
      sudo mkdir -p /srv/rocketpool/data/validators/nimbus/validators

      sudo mkdir -p /srv/rocketpool/data/validators/nimbus/secrets

      sudo chown -R rp:rp /srv/rocketpool/data/validators/nimbus

      sudo chmod -R 775 /srv/rocketpool/data/validators/nimbus
      ```

      Now, add or change the following parameters in Nimbus's service definition file to the following:

      ```
      --validators-dir=/srv/rocketpool/data/validators/nimbus/validators --secrets-dir=/srv/rocketpool/data/validators/nimbus/secrets
      ```
    </Tab>
    <Tab label="Prysm">
      Create the following directories and set their owner to `rp`:

      ```shell
      sudo mkdir -p /srv/rocketpool/data/validators/prysm-non-hd/direct/accounts

      sudo chown -R rp:rp /srv/rocketpool/data/validators/prysm-non-hd

      sudo chmod -R 775 /srv/rocketpool/data/validators/prysm-non-hd
      ```

      Add or change the following parameters in the Prysm VC's service definition file to these new values:

      ```
      --wallet-dir /srv/rocketpool/data/validators/prysm-non-hd --wallet-password-file /srv/rocketpool/data/validators/prysm-non-hd/direct/accounts/secret
      ```

      The VC will fail to start until you make a new Rocket Pool minipool (described later in the guides) because these files won't be created until that time, but the Beacon Node will be able to sync properly.
    </Tab>
    <Tab label="Teku">
      Create the following directories and set their owner to `rp`:

      ```shell
      sudo mkdir -p /srv/rocketpool/data/validators/teku/keys

      sudo mkdir -p /srv/rocketpool/data/validators/teku/passwords

      sudo chown -R rp:rp /srv/rocketpool/data/validators

      sudo chmod -R 775 /srv/rocketpool/data/validators/teku
      ```

      Now, add or change the following parameters in the Teku VC's service definition file to the following:

      ```
      --data-path=/srv/rocketpool/data/validators/teku --validator-keys=/srv/rocketpool/data/validators/teku/keys:/srv/rocketpool/data/validators/teku/passwords
      ```
    </Tab>
  </Tabs>
</div>

### Relaxing `umask`

By default, your system will typically come with a `umask` configuration that will strip the `+w` bit from the group permissions whenever the `node` daemon creates a new folder.
This is problematic for several consensus clients, because they will actually write things such as lock files or other metadata into the directories that the Smartnode creates when it generates new validator keys during a minipool deposit.

To combat this and ensure your VC works correctly, please **relax your `umask` settings**.
For example, instead of `0022`, you should consider setting it to `0002` for the `rp` user.

Every system is different, so please consult [a guide](https://www.howtogeek.com/812961/umask-linux/) that covers your Operating System to learn how to do this.

::: warning WARNING
This step is _crucial_ to ensure the automatic staking and validating duties are handled properly.
If you notice permissions problems in your VC's logs after your minipool passes the 12-hour scrub check and enters `staking` status, you will likely need to run `sudo chmod 775` on the folder containing your validator keys so your VC service can write to that folder.
:::

### Reloading the VC Service

With these changes made, you can now reload and restart the VC service using the following:

```shell
sudo systemctl daemon-reload

sudo systemctl restart <vc-service>
```

**If not using Prysm**, please watch the VC's logs carefully to ensure that it successfully started properly and the following are defined correctly:

- The fee recipient
- The data path
- The wallet / keys / secrets path

You can verify this with, for example, `ps aux | grep fee` to filter the running processes to look at the fee recipient that your VC has used.
**It should be the same one defined in `/srv/rocketpool/data/validators/rp-fee-recipient-env.txt`.**

If they are all using the correct values, then congratulations!
You've successfully set up your Rocket Pool node and can follow the next sections of the guide to learn how to use it.

## Next Steps

Now that your clients are installed, we recommend you take a look at the security suggestions in the [Securing your Node](./securing-your-node) section next.
As you're running a Native setup, you have likely done some of these things already; nevertheless, it doesn't hurt to at least explore it and see how well the recommended security posture fits with your system.
