# Guides Overview

Welcome to the Guides section of the Rocket Pool documentation!
Here you will find various guides that walk you through every step of the various Rocket Pool processes.

## rETH Staker Guide

If you're looking to stake your ETH with Rocket Pool and receive rETH in return, please visit the [rETH Staker Guide](./staking/overview).
Staking is a very simple process, and this guide is filled with step-by-step instructions (including screenshots) that show you how it's done.

## Saturn 0 Guide

For information about the Saturn 0 upgrade, please see [The Saturn 0 Upgrade](./saturn-0/whats-new).

## Node Operator Guide

If you're interested in running a Rocket Pool node to create your own Ethereum validators, take a look at our [Node Operator's guide](./node/responsibilities).
This is a very comprehensive guide that goes over all of the considerations involved in node operation, including:

- Deciding to run a node locally at home, or remotely on the cloud
- Selecting the hardware for a local machine, or selecting a remote hosting provider
- Preparing and securing the operating system of your node
- Selecting your Execution and Consensus clients
- Installing Rocket Pool's Smartnode stack
- Creating a new Beacon Chain validator using the Rocket Pool network
- Maintaining and updating your node
- Participating in on-chain governance

Both guides will show you how to practice for free on the Rocket Pool testnet so you can get a feel for everything without risking any of your real-life ETH, and how to stake your real ETH on the Ethereum mainnet once you're comfortable with the process.

When you're ready, select a guide from the options above based on your interests.
You are also free to explore the various pages using the sidebar to the left.
